# Hotspot Analysis Plugin for QGIS

A QGIS Plugin to perform hotspot and cluster analysis based on the Python Spatial Analysis Library - [PySAL]. 

The Hotspot analysis plugin computes **Z-scores** and **p-values** (under Complete Spatial Randomness hypothesis) of the Gi* local statistic ([Getis and Ord, 1992]; [Getis and Ord, 1996]), Anselin Local Moran's I ([Anselin, 1995]) and Local Moran Bivariate ([Wartenberg, 1985]; [Anselin et al., 2002]) for each geometry of a shapefile, with an assigned **projected coordinate system** and (at least) an associated **numerical attribute**. Output layer allows to identify spatial hot spots/cold spots) as well as clusters/outliers in the input vector dataset. 

Concerning the Gi* local statistic, positive and statistically significant Z-scores indicate an intense cluster of high values (hotspot). Negative and statistically significant Z-scores indicate intense cluster of low values (coldspot). 
With respect to the Local Moran's I (and its bivariate counterpart, the Local Moran Bivariate), Z-scores are translated into quadrant values (q) of the Moran Scatterplot by informing on the presence of clusters or outliers within the dataset. Significance is computed, based on user's choice, against normality assumption or using permutations approach. By default, the significance level is set to 0.05. 
Please consider the litterature references included above for detailed information.

The spatial relationship between point features is modelled using a Fixed Distance Band (expressed with the same unit of measure of the projected coordinate system of the input point shapefile) or optionally using the K-nearest neighbours approach. For polygon shapefile analysis, the spatial relation is modelled using a 1st order queen's case contiguity matrix. For more information, please refer to e.g.: [Geospatial Analysis - 5th Edition, 2015 - de Smith, Goodchild, Longley]

Dependency Requirements:

  - **`PySAL`**
  - **`Numpy`**
  - **`Scipy`**

These libraries are not included in the QGIS core libraries and must be installed prior to the use of the plugin through the [OSGeo4W Shell] on **Windows**, or through the terminal on **Ubuntu** and **macOS** (see the following).

<!---
**Note**:_If you are using the [OSGeo-Live] Virtual Machine, you do not need to install any dependency. You can simply install the plugin from the official **QGIS Python Plugins Repository**. Depending on the pre-installed Pysal version, some of the functionalities might not be available_

```
This will install in your QGIS3 Python 3 environment all the required dependencies. Be sure that the installed PySAL version is <= 1.14.3 Run ```python -m pip show pysal``` for checking it. If the installed version is higher, type ```python -m pip install -I pysal==1.14.3```

**2)** Open QGIS:

A new icon for Hotspot Analysis will appear on the QGIS main panel and in the Vector Menu.

**3)** If you are interested in the **latest unreleased version**:

**Download** the zip folder of the repository at:
https://github.com/danioxoli/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin/archive/qgis3.zip

Open QGIS 3 and go to `Plugins` -> `Install from ZIP`

Select the downloaded zip folder and press `Install plugin`. The icon for the Hotspot Analysis plugin will appear in the list of the installed plugins. Tick the Checkbox to activate it. The plugin will appear in the Vector menu.

**4)** PySAL common error on Windows

* Please, look at https://github.com/danioxoli/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin/issues/15

* If the `spreg` functionalities of PySAL 1.14.3 generate import errors, go to the QGIS libraries folder at
`C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\site-packages\pysal`, open the script `__init__.py` and comment line n. 95

* A **video tutorial** for installation on Windows is available on [here]

**2)** Open QGIS 3:

Go to `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install plugins` -> `Settings` -> `Show also experimental plugins` 

In `All plugins` tab, look for `Hotspot Analysis` and tick the Checkbox.  
A new icon for Hotspot Analysis will appear on the QGIS main panel and in the Vector Menu.


**3)** If you are interested in the **latest unreleased version**:

Open a **Terminal** and change directory to QGIS Plugins directory, default is: 

```sh
 $ cd /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins 
``` 
**Clone** the `GitHub` repository into the earlier mentioned path:

```sh
 $  sudo git clone -b qgis3 https://github.com/danioxoli/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin
```

***Alternatively***

**Download** the zip folder of the repository at:
https://github.com/danioxoli/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin/archive/qgis3.zip

Open QGIS 3 and go to `Plugins` -> `Install from ZIP`

Select the downloaded zip folder and press `Install plugin`. The icon for the Hotspot Analysis plugin will appear in the list of the installed plugins. Tick the Checkbox to activate it. The plugin will appear in the Vector menu.

___
### Installation - macOS

Be sure that the installed PySAL version is <= 1.14.3 Run ```pip3 show pysal``` for checking it. If the installed version is higher, type ```pip3 install -I pysal==1.14.3```

***Alternative***

Open a **Terminal**, update pip3, and install+update the dependencies numpy, scipy, and pysal (suggested by https://github.com/abuabara)

```sh
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
$ sudo -H pip3 install -U numpy
$ sudo -H pip3 install -U scipy

##### Changeset 01/2017
- Enabled the use of negative numerical attributes [Getis and Ord, 1996] 
- Enabled polygon shapefiles as input using queen's case contiguity spatial weight matrix. 
- Enabled the possibility of selecting between normality assumption (default) and standard normal approximation from permutations to compute Gi* Z-scores and associated p-values. 

##### Changeset 12/2016
New check botton to eneable the usage of **row standardized** spatial weights

##### Changeset 11/2016
With this new version, the output layer is displayed with an **automatic style** which enables hotspot and coldspot visualization. Moreover, a **default Fixed Distance Band** is dispalyed. This latter represents the minimum distance to ensure 
at least 1 neighbor to any element of the dataset in order to compute spatial weights for Gi* 

##### Changeset 10/2016
The current version does not require Pyshp as well as to specify the feature coordinates as two separate fields in the attribute table of the input shapefile. Only the numerical attribute must be included and selected using the graphical interface on QGIS. Nevertheless, be sure that your input shapefile is projected. The unit of measure in which you express the analysis distance must agree with the one of the projected coordinate system of your input layer. 

___
### Future work

 - Test on the new functionalities addedd
 - improve GUI appereance
 - Update User guide and documentation for Anselin Local Moran's I and Bivariate Local Moran computation
 - Create a new branch of the sotware without external Python dependnecies
